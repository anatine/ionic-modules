# Cleaning up for non-exports

## `@ionic/react` does not export all helper functions

There is a lot of cross logic between `@ionic/react` and `@ionic/react-router`
Almost no documentation on how animations are handled in the IonicFramework

A more ideal future state would be to have clear docs and methods
on triggering animated transitions.

- When displaying one item then another, where is the actual cloning happening?
